# üêç Snake Game in C++

This is a classic *Snake Game* built using C++ with basic console graphics. The game provides a user-friendly interface, allowing the player to control a snake, eat food to grow, and avoid obstacles or collisions with walls and its own body. The game features different difficulty levels and high score tracking.

## üéÆ Game Overview

In this Snake game:
- The snake moves in a **2D grid environment**.
- The goal is to **eat food** (represented by `*`) and grow the snake‚Äôs length.
- Players control the snake using **arrow keys** (or **W, A, S, D**).
- The snake must avoid hitting:
  - **Walls**
  - **Obstacles**
  - **Its own body**
- The game offers multiple **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, High, Expert) with varying speeds and obstacle density.

## üåü Features

- **Boundary Wall:** The snake can‚Äôt cross the game boundary.
- **Food Collection:** Eating food grows the snake and increases the score.
- **Obstacles:** Increasing obstacles with higher difficulty levels.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the highest score in the current session.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Multiple difficulty levels with varying speed and obstacles.
- **User Input:** Supports keyboard input for controlling the snake.

## üìú Game Rules

1. Use the **W, A, S, D** keys (or the arrow keys) to control the snake:
   - **W / Up Arrow**: Move Up
   - **S / Down Arrow**: Move Down
   - **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
   - **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right
2. The snake moves continuously in the current direction until you change it.
3. The snake grows longer when it eats food (indicated by `*`).
4. Avoid hitting:
   - **The walls**
   - **The snake's own body**
   - **Obstacles**
5. Each game round gets harder as you level up.
6. The game keeps track of your **current score** and **highest score**.

## üõ† OOP Concepts Used

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
   - **Snake Class**: Handles the snake‚Äôs body, direction, and movement. The Snake class defines methods for controlling the snake and checking for collisions.
   - **Point Class**: Represents coordinates on the grid (used for snake body, food, and obstacles).

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - The snake‚Äôs movement, length, and direction are encapsulated within the Snake class. The game‚Äôs logic interacts with the class without exposing its internal details.

### 3. **Abstraction**
   - The complexity of the snake‚Äôs behavior (like collision detection and movement) is abstracted into methods within the Snake class, providing a clean interface for interaction in the main game loop.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   - While the game does not fully implement polymorphism, its modular structure allows for future extensions, like adding different types of snakes with varied behaviors using polymorphism.

### 5. **Modularity**
   - The game logic is divided into modular functions and classes, making it scalable for future features like adding more power-ups or different obstacles.

## üìö Data Structures Used

### 1. **Array**
   - An array is used to represent the grid in the game. The grid is the environment where the snake moves and the food appears.

### 2. **Vector**
   - The snake's body is represented by a vector, allowing dynamic growth as the snake eats food. The vector stores each part of the snake's body as the game progresses.

### 3. **Queue**
   - A queue is used to efficiently manage the snake‚Äôs movement by storing the previous positions. This helps track the snake‚Äôs head and body efficiently.

### 4. **Boolean Array**
   - A boolean array is used to track the positions of the grid and check for obstacles and collisions. This helps in determining whether a particular grid cell is empty, contains food, or contains an obstacle.

## üïπ Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start Screen**: When the game begins, you'll be prompted to enter your name.
2. **Difficulty Level**: Choose a difficulty level from 1 (Easy) to 4 (Expert).
3. **Movement**: Use arrow keys or **W, A, S, D** to move the snake.
4. **Score**: Your score will be displayed on the top-left. Eating food increases the score.
5. **Game Over**: If the snake hits the wall, its own body, or an obstacle, the game ends.
