## üéÆ Game Overview

In this Snake game:
- The snake moves in a 2D grid environment.
- The goal is to eat food represented by `*` and grow the snake‚Äôs length.
- Players control the snake using arrow keys (or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`).
- The snake must avoid hitting walls, obstacles, and itself.
- The game has multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, High, and Expert) with varying speeds and obstacle density.

## üåü Features

- **Boundary Wall:** The snake can‚Äôt cross the game boundary.
- **Food Collection:** Eating food grows the snake and increases the score.
- **Obstacles:** Increasing obstacles with higher difficulty levels.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the highest score in the current session.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Multiple difficulty levels with varying speed and obstacles.
- **User Input:** Supports keyboard input for controlling the snake.

## üìú Game Rules

1. Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** keys (or the arrow keys) to control the snake:
   - **W / Up Arrow**: Move Up
   - **S / Down Arrow**: Move Down
   - **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
   - **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right
2. The snake moves continuously in the current direction until you change it.
3. The snake grows longer when it eats food (indicated by `*`).
4. Avoid hitting:
   - **The walls**
   - **The snake's own body**
   - **Obstacles**
5. Each game round gets harder as you level up.
6. The game keeps track of your **current score** and **highest score**.

## üõ†Ô∏è OOP Concepts Used

### **1. Classes and Objects**
   - **Snake Class**: Handles the snake‚Äôs body, direction, and movement. The `Snake` class defines methods for controlling the snake and checking for collisions.
   - **Point Class**: Represents coordinates on the grid (used for snake body, food, and obstacles).

### **2. Encapsulation**
   - The snake‚Äôs movement, length, and direction are encapsulated within the `Snake` class. The game‚Äôs logic interacts with the class without exposing its internal details.

### **3. Abstraction**
   - The complexity of the snake‚Äôs behavior (like collision detection and movement) is abstracted into methods within the `Snake` class, providing a clean interface for interaction in the main game loop.

### **4. Polymorphism**
   - While the game does not fully implement polymorphism, its modular structure allows for future extensions, like adding different types of snakes with varied behaviors using polymorphism.

### **5. Modularity**
   - The game logic is divided into modular functions and classes, making it scalable for future features like adding more power-ups or different obstacles.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start Screen**: When the game begins, you'll be prompted to enter your name.
2. **Difficulty Level**: Choose a difficulty level from 1 (Easy) to 4 (Expert).
3. **Movement**: Use arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the snake.
4. **Score**: Your score will be displayed on the top-left. Eating food increases the score.
5. **Game Over**: If the snake hits the wall, its own body, or an obstacle, the game ends.
