## üéÆ Game Overview

In this Snake game:
- The snake moves in a **2D grid environment**.
- The goal is to **eat food** (represented by `+`) and grow the snake‚Äôs length.
- Players control the snake using **arrow keys** (or **W, A, S, D**).
- The snake must avoid hitting:
  - **Walls**
  - **Obstacles**
  - **Its own body**
- The game offers multiple **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, High, Expert) with varying speeds and obstacle density.

## üåü Features

- **Boundary Wall:** The snake can‚Äôt cross the game boundary.
- **Food Collection:** Eating food grows the snake and increases the score.
- **Obstacles:** Increasing obstacles with higher difficulty levels.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the highest score in the current session.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Multiple difficulty levels with varying speed and obstacles.
- **User Input:** Supports keyboard input for controlling the snake.

## üìú Game Rules

1. Use the **W, A, S, D** keys (or the arrow keys) to control the snake:
   - **W / Up Arrow**: Move Up
   - **S / Down Arrow**: Move Down
   - **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
   - **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right
2. The snake moves continuously in the current direction until you change it.
3. The snake grows longer when it eats food (indicated by `+`).
4. Avoid hitting:
   - **The walls**
   - **The snake's own body**
   - **Obstacles**
5. Each game round gets harder as you level up.
6. The game keeps track of your **current score** and **highest score**.

## üõ† OOP Concepts Used

### 1. **Classes and Objects**: 
   - The `Snake` class encapsulates the snake‚Äôs attributes (body, length, direction) and behaviors (moving, changing direction, eating food).

### 2. **Encapsulation**: 
   - The internal state (snake's body and direction) is hidden within the `Snake` class, with public methods (`move()`, `changeDirection()`, etc.) to interact with it.

### 3. **Abstraction**: 
   - The complex logic of moving the snake and handling collisions is abstracted away, allowing the game loop to focus on high-level functionality.

## Data Structures Used
The game utilizes several data structures to manage the game state, including:

1. **Point Struct**: 
   - Represents a 2D coordinate (`x`, `y`) on the screen. Used for the snake's body, food, and obstacles.

2. **Array of Points**: 
   - The snake's body is represented as an array of `Point` structures. The array grows as the snake eats food.

3. **Vector of Points**: 
   - Obstacles are stored dynamically in a `vector` of `Point` structures. Obstacles are generated randomly within the console window.

4. **Class Snake**: 
   - Manages the snake's movement, length, and direction. It also handles collision detection with walls, itself, and obstacles.

5. **Input Handling**: 
   - The `_kbhit()` and `_getch()` functions (from `<conio.h>`) are used to detect player input for controlling the snake's direction.

## üïπ Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start Screen**: When the game begins, you'll be prompted to enter your name.
2. **Difficulty Level**: Choose a difficulty level from 1 (Easy) to 4 (Expert).
3. **Movement**: Use arrow keys or **W, A, S, D** to move the snake.
4. **Score**: Your score will be displayed on the top-left. Eating food increases the score.
5. **Game Over**: If the snake hits the wall, its own body, or an obstacle, the game ends.
